Eugene Jang is a doctoral candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California, and a Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) fellow. Prior to joining USC, she graduated from Seoul National University (SNU), receiving her B.A. and M.A. in communication. She formerly served as a research assistant at the SNU Big Data Institute and also worked for the SNU Human Ecology Research Institute, focusing on surveillance, data brokers, and privacy.

Her research interests include health communication, digital/social media, artificial intelligence (AI), science and technology studies (STS), social network analysis, and computational social science. She takes a mixed methods approach combining both computational and qualitative analyses for her research. Her dissertation focuses on comparing social support dynamics across social media platforms through social network analysis. She is also interested in studying how AI can be leveraged to enhance health and social equity.
